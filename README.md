# SULS-IJOC2021

date : 22/07/2021

This repository has as main objective to provide the relevant data, source code and results of the extSDDiP algorithm  published in INFORMS Journal on Computing.

Results are provided in three files.

1) Results in Tables 1-4  and 6-9 of the manuscript can be found in "Performance of each method at solving instances from Set 1, 2 and 3 of the SULS problem (extSDDiP-I and extSDDiP-I-II).ods"
2) Results in Tables 10-13 of the manuscript can be found in "Performance of each method at solving instances from Set 1, 2 et 3  of the SULS problem (ExtSDDiP-II).ods"
3) Results in Table 14 of the manuscript can be found in "Performance of each method at solving instances with Sigma=20  of the SULS problem (ExtSDDiP-I-II).ods"

Each file contains self-explanatory header columns.

Data (instances of the SULS) is provided in a zip file which contains 3 folders.

1) Folder Instances_s4_s6 contains instances with 4 and 6 stages.
2) Folder Instances_s8_s12 contains instances with 8 and 12 stages.
3) Folder Instances_s20 contains instances with 20 stages.

Each instance is composed of a series of vectors that represent a set of realization of the stochastic parameters in the following order. 

1) Demand
2) Set-up cost
3) Inventory holding cost
4) Realization probability 
5) Production cost
